# TaffyTangle
A match three game made in Python for a first year assignment. It utilizes the moduels stddraw, stdio, and color from the Princeton Education Booksite. It includes two difficulties, and a hint button for when you are stuck. The difficulties each have a different number of game pieces and score targets. There is a move limit so if you do not reach the target score you lose.
